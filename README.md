# NetworkAlertSystem
A small project that will alert the user if they're downloading too much too quickly!

A simple console application that will print out the upload/download each second, and if it's higher than the threshold it will post a notification balloon!

The threshhold can be modified via a threshhold.txt file in the same directory as the executable, containing the Mbps.
